Hi I am Souvik Pramanick,currently pursuinf Btech degree from in Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology. I am an aspiring lad,
prepared for any moment,loves coding all day and learning from you. He's currently learning Java and Python at CODEWITHHARRY. He is also a huge fan of Harry Potter, so he has made a really creative brand name out of this conference with the help of JAVA & PYTHON. It totally makes sense when you have that much enthusiasm in coding!
